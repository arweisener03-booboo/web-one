<em>A little bit about me..</em>
<p>I was born in Belleville Ontario, not far from my mother’s home town. My father’s family has deep roots here on the east coast, and I moved to Nova Scotia when I was about 10 years old. I’ve lived here for over a decade. I enjoy it very much, but of course there’s downsides. The first thing that always comes to mind is the fact that cheese curds suck here. The second is the sleet in the winter, but I feel like that goes without saying. The greatest pro to living here is the ocean, the Atlantic offers a freshness and breeze that I can’t see myself living without now. </p>
<p>I started studying art seriously in high school, and when I graduated I earned an IB art diploma. I’ve always loved graphic design, but after completing AMCA last year, I found a drive and passion for it that I hadn’t had before. And now I’m here to learn, fail, and succeed as much as possible. </p>
